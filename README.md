# Tate Marketing Analyst Technical Test

Congratulations on being selected to take part in this next stage. This is the repository containing instructions and base data for a technical test for the Marketing Data Analyst role. Please follow the instructions below to complete and submit the technical test. If you are successful at this stage, you will be invited to a final stage interview at Tate.

# Data

We have provided a sample data set, based on renewal offers for car insurance policies. The company has sent their customer base four different renewal offers via different channels. Various attributes of the customer, which offer they were presented, and whether or not they responded to the offer are included in the table.

This can be found in the `/data` directory of this repository.

# The Test!

The premise is simple - the company intends to run this campaign again, and is eager for advise on improving the response rate.

In addition to an overview of the data set, please make a robustly substantiated case for ONE modification to the campaign which would substantially improve the response rate. Demonstrate the level of improvement the company can expect from it.

Finally, highlight key areas that the company needs to further investigate. In this case, please recommend steps (changes to the campaign and/or additional research) that it can implement in order to arrive at meaningful insights.

# Submission

Your response to this test should consist of two elements: an executive summary of no more than 500 words that outlines your conclusions and  recommendations, and a document showing us your working process.

Any of the following approaches and formats are accepted, however please stick to **one only**:

-	Set up your analysis in Microsoft Excel, and clearly label all your tables, sheets, and graphs so that we understand their purpose
-	Perform your analysis in a Jupyter notebook, with either Python or R, and send us the .ipynb file. You can use Microsoft’s free notebook services, available at https://notebooks.azure.com, and download your finished document.
-	Provide a well-documented R script that you are confident we will be able to run
-	Provide us with a Power BI report. This can be downloaded as a free tool here: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/
-	Perform your analysis in other statistical or BI software (SPSS, Stata, Qlik, etc.) and document the steps and outcomes in a separate document (this can be a Word document, or a Latex file/pdf)

While we expect the response you arrive at to be succinct, it is essential that we understand your workings and thought process. Regardless of the format in which you choose to send us your work files, at this stage we are interested in seeing:
-	how you explored the data and constructed your understanding of the sample and its characteristics
-	how you manipulated the data to arrive at your response and recommendations

# Submission

Please return a written response of 500 words or less, together with your code or the documentation of your process, to osman.yilmaz@tate.org.uk.

The end-date for submissions is by Midnight on Sunday 30 September.

# Good luck!
